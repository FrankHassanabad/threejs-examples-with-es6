ThreeJS Examples for learning.  Written in ES6 but <i>without</i> 
Frameworks and tools such as React, AngularJS, babel, typescript,
webpack, etc...  This is to concentrate on ES6 with threeJS alone.
ESLint available to try and keep the code the style I personally enjoy.
These examples will only work with the latest Chrome, Firefox, and IE.

I do use http2 for the server, eslint for the code, and some unit tests.  However,
none that should be a distraction from the main goal of experimenting and learning 
threejs with ES6 style syntax.

Some models are from magica voxel and some are from threeJS:
