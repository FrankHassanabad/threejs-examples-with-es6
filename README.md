ThreeJS Examples
=======

ThreeJS Examples for learning.  Written in ES6 but <i>without</i> 
Frameworks and tools such as React, AngularJS, babel, typescript,
webpack, etc...  This is to concentrate on ES6 with threeJS alone.
ESLint available to try and keep the code the style I personally enjoy.
These examples will only work with the latest Chrome, Firefox, and IE.
